# raport_placowy_SQL
The goal of this project is to learn how to build SQL queries with MySQL and use this knowledge to create payment reports based on an available employee database. The project is based on the "employee" database, which is a public database of (untrue) employees data such as personal details, duration of employment, department where they work and salaries. The "payment_report" project has been divided into four separate parts, in which we perform various tasks to finally give an effect in the form of query results ready for analysis.

The data comes from the "employee" database, which can be downloaded here: https://relational.fit.cvut.cz/dataset/Employee.

There are 6 tables in the database: employees, salaries, departments, titles, dept_emp, dept_manager.

The employees table contains personal information about employees, the salaries table contains information about salaries, the dept_emp table shows in which department the employee works in and the departments table shows information about these departments. In the database, there are also title and dept_manager tables, but they are not used in this project. 

The repository also includes a simple diagram of the base on which the project is made. File with schema of database is called 'schema.svg'.
